# Telecare
It is a Medical website desgined by me, in which only front-end work had taken place.
It is not a responsive website so it will only work on desktop pages.
It is basically an idea and the design for the competition "Hackfest" which was held at Meerut Institute of Engineering Technology.
We are on the Team "Morse Coders" and came as a finalist of the competition.
